## Database Design

### users

Stores registered users and authentication information.

### stations

Stores all transportation stations.

### lines

Stores transportation lines.

### segments

Stores station-to-station connections.

### events

Stores random journey events and score effects.

### games

Stores submitted routes and achieved scores.

---

## Design Decisions

### Backend

The backend follows a layered architecture:

* Routes manage HTTP requests and responses.
* DAOs manage database access.
* Utilities encapsulate graph algorithms, route validation, and game execution logic.
* Passport.js handles authentication.

### Frontend

The frontend follows a component-based architecture:

* React Router manages navigation.
* Pages are organized by responsibility.
* API calls are centralized in a dedicated API module.
* State is managed through React hooks.

---

## Transportation Network

Last Race is built around a fictional student-themed transportation network inspired by life in Turin.

The network consists of:

* 4 transportation lines
* 15 stations
* Multiple interchange stations
* 15 station-to-station segments

### Example Lines

* Caffeine Line
* Panic Line
* Aperitivo Line
* Startup Line

### Example Stations

* Main Campus
* Central Library
* Exam Center
* Porta Nuova
* Innovation Hub
* Startup District

The transportation network is modeled as a graph and is used to generate missions, validate routes, and compute shortest paths.
